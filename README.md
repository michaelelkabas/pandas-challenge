As described in the challenge, we have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 
There is access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 
In the code we have to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 
The code also shows the results for various data points outlined below which highlights insights into the

enabling stakeholders to formulate informed decisions and strategies for educational advancement.
